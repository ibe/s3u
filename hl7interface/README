== Intention
* simple storage of hl7 messages from eGate
* authentication required (via activedirectory)
* authorization implemented (appropriate activedirectory group membership required)
== Note
* cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml (and set db credentials)
* cp config/ldap.yml.example config/ldap.yml (and set ldap credentials)
* check reasonable credentials at config/ldap.yml (section 'development')
* directory perl_service contains the perl service, that receives socket-based HL7 messages (from eGate)
== Change Log
* (+) ActiveDirectory authentication
* (o) put reasonable credentials in ldap.yml (incl. SSL)
* (+) authentication SSL-ified
* (+) authorization via ActiveDirectory

(+) newly added
(o) todo
