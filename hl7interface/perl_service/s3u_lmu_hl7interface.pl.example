# This is a placeholer for a simple perl-based TCP server receiving HL7 messages and writing
# the results to a database.
#
# Unfortunately it does not seem possible to publish the source code as someone seems
# to think that it violates his intellectual property. For political reasons, I will not comment
# on this further, except for the fact, that I do not think, that I have violated IP's.
# 
# Hint: These CPAN modules were used:
#  Log::Log4perl
#  Net::HL7::Daemon
#  DBI
#  DBD::mysql
#
# Instructions:
#  * create a daemon and listen to a particular TCP port to which HL7 messages are sent by a HL7 client
#  * use public available documentation on HL7 to determine, which data you need from the whole HL7 stream
#  * store it into your database
#  * done
